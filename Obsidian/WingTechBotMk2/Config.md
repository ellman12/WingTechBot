Most of the values in the `config.json` should be self-explanatory. However, some require more explanation.

## BotAdmins
Currently unused. In the very likely future, it will be used to specify the usernames of people who have admin control of the bot.

## StartDate
This is the cutoff date for reaction events. If one is added to or removed from a message sent before this date, it is ignored. This value must be provided in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format.
