This will store all config for the bot. There will be a `config_example.json` which will have default values, and the real thing will not be stored in Git because this is where the bot's API token will be stored.

## Values
### Token
Bot API token.

### Bot Admins
Array of usernames for who are considered admins of the bot and thus can run exclusive [[Admin Commands]]. 

### Karma Start Date
Any up/down votes and awards before this date will be ignored.

### Status Message
The Discord status of the bot.
