A rewrite of Ben's [WingTechBot](https://github.com/benjaminiserman/WingTechBot) designed for [[Cloud Hosting|the cloud]].

## Motivations
1. Get more relevant experience on my resume.
2. Overhaul the [[Advanced Karma System|karma system]] because I'm horny for data and stats.
3. The existing bot code is meh (no offense Ben). There's also a lot of weird and unused commands.
5. Get more experience contributing to open source and doing PRs.
6. I want a good fork of a repo on my GitHub profile.

## Project Plan and MVP
- [x] Figure out the basics of making a bot
- [x] Figure out how to use Docker and get the basic bot working in it
- [x] Set up docker compose on local
- [x] Figure out how to use AWS or another method of [[Cloud Hosting]]
	- [x] Get a basic bot on the cloud.
	- [x] Get it to receive commands.
	- [x] Figure out how to use a database with it.
- [x] Create testing csproj and organize existing project files.
- [ ] Create notes on how this was all setup
- [ ] Research and do Agile and TDD stuff
- [ ] [[Advanced Karma System]]
- [ ] Have people check the security of the bot
- [ ] 

## Additional Features I'd Like
- [ ] [[Quote System]]
- [ ] [[Gato]] command
- [ ] Other smaller commands like [[Random Number Generation]]

## Future Possibilities
- [ ] Ability for it to join a voice channel and do... stuff idk. Play sounds, soundboard sounds, etc.
- [ ] AI/LLM stuff. Interface with ChatGPT, etc.
