A rewrite of Ben's [WingTechBot](https://github.com/benjaminiserman/WingTechBot) designed for [[Cloud Hosting|the cloud]].

## Motivations
1. Get more relevant experience on my resume.
2. Overhaul the [[Advanced Karma System|karma system]] because I'm horny for data and stats.
3. The existing bot code is meh (no offense Ben). There's also a lot of weird and unused commands.
5. Get more experience contributing to open source and doing PRs.
6. I want a good fork of a repo on my GitHub profile.

## Project Plan
