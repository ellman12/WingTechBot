Gato is a silly little command for storing pictures and videos (<= 10 MB) of cats. 

`/gato-add` is used to upload the file, optionally including a name to associate with the cat.

`/gato-top` is similar to [[Reaction Tracking and Karma#/top]] and is used to show a leaderboard for which cats have the most files:
