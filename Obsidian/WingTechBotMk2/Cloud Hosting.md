The plan is to host this thing on AWS as long as it will be free, forever. I have a strong feeling AWS will look better on my resume. If Amazon screws us over with the free tier or something else happens, a good Plan B would be Google Cloud. They have a real nice free tier. Other options include Cloudflare and Oracle. Apparently, they have better free tiers since they're less popular.
