I want the bot to be able to store and retrieve quotes from any user on the server.


## Tables

| Quote (markdown string) | Person | Times Quoted (int) | Created At | Updated At |
| ----------------------- | ------ | ------------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
|                         |        |                    |            |            |


## Operations
Being able to reply to a message with a command to add that as a quote.

Pick random quote (from a person or anyone).

List all quotes by a user, or all quotes for all users.

### Potential Operations
Adding quote quick-commands, like ?elliottt-1
