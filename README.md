6. Generate an invite URL for your bot and use it to add the bot to your server.

10. Replace the null value under "UserId" with the bot's Discord user ID.
11. Replace the null value under "ServerId" with your Discord server ID (right-click your server icon on the left in Discord and choose "Copy ID", it should be one really big number).
12. If you have a designated bot channel, replace the null value under "BotChannelID" with the ID of that channel.
13. Run your fork of the repo again. WingTech Bot should deploy to your server.
14. Modify your fork of the repo at your leisure.

If you're looking for how to implement a game for WingTech Bot, I'd recommend looking at the file "Counting.cs". It's a pretty simple game that shows of the basics of the WingTechBot game platform.

My code uses reflection to create the game pool. Any class deriving from the abstract class **Game** will be automatically added to the available games. However, to add games to the my version of WingTech Bot, you'll have to submit a pull request as explained above.
